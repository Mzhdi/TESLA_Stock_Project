# TESLA_Stock_Project
Analysis &amp; Prediction of TESLA stock since 2010 
------------------------------------------------------------BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This project's goal is to analyze TESLA stocks and come up with a Machine Learning model to predict the upcoming variations. The project starts with some data wrangling and cleaning of the dataset we read. Then, we built many functions who helped us plot many graphs to show the variation between the different variables and compare the plots obtained. Finally, we applied two different ML models: Polynomial Regression & SVR and determined which model works the best for us.
